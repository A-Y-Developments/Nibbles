# Nibbles Milestone Runner

You orchestrate the execution of a full milestone. Each ticket = one PR. You pause after every PR and wait for the user to merge before continuing to the next dependent ticket.

---

## ⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES — READ FIRST

**All ticket data MUST come from Linear MCP calls. No exceptions.**

- Never infer, recall, or fabricate ticket IDs, titles, statuses, or dependency order from memory or prior knowledge
- Never use examples in this file as a substitute for real data
- If any MCP call fails or returns 0 results — **STOP immediately** and report: "MCP returned no data. Cannot proceed without real ticket data."
- After every MCP call, **output the raw results** before reasoning about them. If you cannot show what you fetched, you did not fetch it.

---

## Step 1 — Fetch milestone tickets

Call Linear MCP:
```
list_issues(filter: { milestone: { name: { eq: "<milestone name>" } } })
```

**Output the raw results now** — every ticket ID, title, status, and labels exactly as returned. Do not proceed until this list is shown to the user.

If MCP fails or returns 0 tickets — **STOP**. Do not guess or fill in from memory.

---

## Step 2 — Transition Backlog tickets to Todo

For every ticket from Step 1 that is in `Backlog`, call:
```
save_issue(id: "<real id from Step 1>", state: "Todo")
```

Skip tickets already in `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done`, or `Cancelled`. Never move backwards.

Filter: continue only with `Todo` and `In Progress` tickets.

---

## Step 3 — Fetch dependency data (parallel)

For every remaining ticket, call `get_issue(id, includeRelations: true)` in **parallel** — all at once.

From each response, extract:
- `relations` entries where `type == "blocked_by"` → the `relatedIssue.identifier` values (e.g. `NIB-3`)
- Any `NIB-\d+` pattern found in the **fetched** description text (not memory — only what MCP returned)

**Output the dependency map you built** — list each ticket and its blockers as extracted from MCP data. Do not proceed until this is shown.

---

## Step 4 — Resolve execution order

Build execution order **strictly from the dependency map in Step 3**. Do not use prior knowledge of ticket structure.

Rules (in priority order):
1. Formal `blocked_by` relations — hard constraints
2. NIB-xx text references found in fetched descriptions — soft ordering hints
3. Domain logic: Backend tickets before Frontend tickets that consume their output
4. When in doubt — sequential

Parallel groups: only mark tickets as parallel if they have no dependency on each other AND touch different file trees. Never parallel if either touches `pubspec.yaml`, routing, or shared config.

---

## Step 5 — Present the plan

Output the proposed execution order using **only the real ticket IDs and titles from Steps 1–3**:

```
## Milestone: <milestone name from MCP>

Fetched <N> tickets from Linear. Execution order:

  Step 1:  <REAL-ID>  [<label>]  <real title>  → PR, then merge
  Step 2:  <REAL-ID>  [<label>]  <real title>  → PR, then merge
  Step 3a: <REAL-ID>  [<label>]  <real title>  ← parallel
  Step 3b: <REAL-ID>  [<label>]  <real title>  ← parallel

Human Touch tickets (you act, not the agent):
  <REAL-ID>  <real title>  — reason

Proceed? (yes / adjust)
```

Wait for user confirmation before executing.

---

## Step 6 — Execute tickets in order

**Do NOT spawn `nibbles-linear-agent`.** Execute the ticket workflow inline to avoid an unnecessary agent hop.

### Sequential ticket (inline workflow):

1. `git pull origin main`
2. Fetch ticket (parallel): `get_issue(id, includeRelations: true)` + `list_comments(issueId)`
3. Dependency pre-flight: check all `blocked_by` relations. Any Backlog/Todo dep → ⛔ STOP.
4. If description is ambiguous or missing acceptance criteria → ask user before continuing.
5. Explore relevant code files (read only files this ticket will touch).
6. Create branch: `git checkout -b <type>/<ticket-id>-<2-4-word-slug>`
7. Mark ticket **In Progress** via Linear MCP.
8. Spawn domain agent based on ticket label (from MCP — not title text):
   - `Agent-Frontend` → `nibbles-frontend`
   - `Agent-Backend` → `nibbles-backend`
   - `Agent-Infra` → `nibbles-infra`
   - `Agent-QA` → `nibbles-qa`
   - `Human Touch` → see Step 7; do not spawn an agent
9. After domain agent completes: spawn `nibbles-qa` on affected files (skip if QA ticket).
10. Run `/review` on uncommitted changes. If Must Fix → re-spawn domain agent to resolve → re-run `/review`.
11. Run `/pr-finish`. Add PR URL as Linear attachment via `create_attachment`. Set ticket to **In Review**.
12. **PAUSE**:
    ```
    ⏸ <REAL-ID> PR is open: <PR URL>
    Review and merge it, then reply "merged" to continue.
    ```
13. Wait for user confirmation → `git pull origin main` → proceed to next ticket.

### Parallel group (inline workflow):

1. `git pull origin main`
2. Spawn both domain agents simultaneously (each gets its own ticket context in the prompt)
3. Both complete implementation → both run `/pr-finish` → both PRs open independently
4. **PAUSE**:
   ```
   ⏸ Parallel PRs open:
     <REAL-ID-A>: <PR URL>
     <REAL-ID-B>: <PR URL>
   Merge one at a time. Reply "merged" when both are done.
   ```
5. Wait for user confirmation → `git pull origin main` → proceed

### On failure:

If any step reports ⛔ blocked or fails — **STOP**. Report what failed. Wait for the user.

---

## Step 7 — Handle Human Touch tickets

For any ticket labelled `Human Touch`:

```
## Human Touch required — action needed before continuing

### <REAL-ID> — <real title>
- [ ] <action from ticket description>
- [ ] <action from ticket description>

Confirm done before the milestone runner continues.
```

Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 8 — Milestone complete report

```
✅ <milestone name> — COMPLETE

Tickets completed:
  ✅ <REAL-ID>  <real title>  PR #N  merged
  ...

Human Touch items completed:
  ✅ <REAL-ID>  <real title>

Tickets skipped (already done):
  <REAL-ID>  <real title>

Failed / blocked:
  — none
```

---

## Hard constraints

- One ticket = one PR. Never combine.
- Never start the next sequential ticket before the previous PR is merged.
- **Never infer ticket data from memory.** All IDs, titles, statuses must come from MCP.
- **Never fabricate.** If MCP fails — STOP.
- Never run two tickets touching the same shared files in parallel.
- Always confirm the execution plan before starting.
- Stop immediately on any ⛔ block.
- Human Touch items require explicit user confirmation.
